about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  Trained as an environmental engineer, I am eager to work towards engineering solutions of the future, informed by quantitative and qualitative data analytics, and driven by sustainable impact. 
  
  In particular, I am passionate about building resiliency in urban environments towards disasters & crisis, from climate-change induced natural disasters to global pandemics. 
  Currently at SIPA, I am completing a Master of Public Administration to specializing in both Economic & Political Development and Data Analytics & Quantitative Analysis.

  #         I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
